# Plugin Architecture

The System Configuration component uses a plugin-based architecture that allows different components to manage different aspects of system configuration. This page provides detailed information about the plugin architecture and how to develop plugins for the System Configuration component.

## Overview

The plugin architecture of the System Configuration component is designed to be:

- **Extensible**: New plugins can be added to support additional configuration aspects
- **Modular**: Each plugin is responsible for a specific aspect of system configuration
- **Decoupled**: Plugins operate independently but can communicate through the central service
- **Robust**: Plugins can be updated or replaced without affecting other plugins

## Plugin Service

The central component of the System Configuration system is the SysConfigService, which manages plugins and state. Plugins register with the service and provide functionality for managing specific aspects of system configuration.

## Communication

System Configuration uses gRPC over Unix sockets for communication between the service and plugins. This provides a well-defined API and efficient binary serialization.

The communication flow typically looks like this:

1. The SysConfigService starts and listens on a Unix socket
2. Plugins connect to the socket and register with the service
3. The service sends configuration requests to plugins
4. Plugins process the requests and send responses back to the service
5. The service aggregates responses and manages the overall system state

## Plugin Interface

Plugins implement the `PluginService` gRPC service, which defines the following methods:

- `Initialize`: Initialize the plugin with a plugin ID and service socket path
- `GetConfig`: Return the plugin's current configuration
- `DiffState`: Compare the current state with a desired state and return the differences
- `ApplyState`: Apply a new state to the system
- `ExecuteAction`: Execute an action on the system
- `NotifyStateChange`: Handle a state change notification

## Plugin Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a plugin typically follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**: The plugin is started and initializes itself
2. **Registration**: The plugin registers with the SysConfigService
3. **Configuration**: The plugin receives configuration from the service
4. **Operation**: The plugin processes requests from the service
5. **Termination**: The plugin is stopped when the service is stopped or when it's no longer needed

## Developing Plugins

To develop a plugin for the System Configuration component, you need to:

1. Implement the `PluginService` gRPC service
2. Handle the plugin lifecycle
3. Process configuration requests
4. Apply configuration changes to the system

### Plugin Implementation

Here's a simplified example of a plugin implementation in Rust:

```rust
// Import necessary dependencies
use sysconfig::plugin::{Plugin, Result};

// Define a plugin struct
struct MyPlugin {
    // Plugin state
}

// Implement the Plugin trait for MyPlugin
impl Plugin for MyPlugin {
    // Initialize the plugin
    fn initialize(&mut self, plugin_id: &str, socket_path: &str) -> Result<()> {
        // Initialization code
        Ok(())
    }
    
    // Get the current configuration
    fn get_config(&self) -> Result<String> {
        // Return the current configuration as JSON
        Ok("{}".to_string())
    }
    
    // Compare states and return differences
    fn diff_state(&self, current: &str, desired: &str) -> Result<Vec<String>> {
        // Compare states and return differences
        Ok(vec![])
    }
    
    // Apply a new state
    fn apply_state(&mut self, state: &str, dry_run: bool) -> Result<Vec<String>> {
        // Apply the new state
        Ok(vec![])
    }
    
    // Execute an action
    fn execute_action(&mut self, action: &str, params: &str) -> Result<String> {
        // Execute the action
        Ok("".to_string())
    }
    
    // Handle state change notifications
    fn notify_state_change(&mut self, event: &str) -> Result<()> {
        // Handle the notification
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Plugin Registration

Plugins register with the SysConfigService during initialization:

```rust
fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Create the plugin
    let plugin = MyPlugin::new();
    
    // Register the plugin with the service
    let client = PluginClient::new("my-plugin", "/path/to/socket", plugin)?;
    
    // Run the plugin
    client.run()?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Configuration Processing

Plugins process configuration by implementing methods to get the current configuration, compare states, and apply changes:

```rust
// Example of configuration processing functions

// Get the current configuration
fn get_plugin_config() -> String {
    // Return the current configuration as JSON
    let config = format!("{{ \"setting\": \"value\" }}");
    config
}

// Compare states and return differences
fn compare_states(current: &str, desired: &str) -> Vec<String> {
    // In a real implementation, this would parse and compare JSON
    // For this example, we'll just return a simple difference
    vec!["setting: old_value -> new_value".to_string()]
}

// Apply a new state
fn apply_new_state(state: &str, dry_run: bool) -> Vec<String> {
    // In a real implementation, this would parse JSON and apply changes
    // For this example, we'll just return what would be applied
    if !dry_run {
        // Apply the changes (not shown in this example)
    }
    
    // Return the changes that were applied or would be applied
    vec!["Applied setting: new_value".to_string()]
}
```

### Action Execution

Plugins can execute actions by implementing the execute_action method:

```rust
// Execute an action
fn execute_plugin_action(action: &str, params: &str) -> String {
    match action {
        "restart" => {
            // Restart the service
            "Service restarted".to_string()
        }
        "status" => {
            // Get the service status
            "Service is running".to_string()
        }
        _ => {
            // Unsupported action
            format!("Unsupported action: {}", action)
        }
    }
}
```

### State Change Notifications

Plugins can receive state change notifications:

```rust
// Handle state change notifications
fn handle_state_change(event: &str) {
    // In a real implementation, this would parse JSON and handle events
    println!("Received event: {}", event);
    
    // Example of handling specific events
    if event.contains("network") && event.contains("interfaces") {
        println!("Network interface change detected");
        // Handle network interface changes
    }
}
```

## Plugin Types

The System Configuration component supports various types of plugins, including:

### System Plugins

System plugins manage core system settings, such as:
- Hostname
- Time zone
- Locale
- Users and groups

### Network Plugins

Network plugins manage network settings, such as:
- Interfaces
- IP addresses
- Routing
- DNS

### Service Plugins

Service plugins manage system services, such as:
- SMF services
- Daemons
- Scheduled tasks

### Storage Plugins

Storage plugins manage storage settings, such as:
- ZFS pools
- Filesystems
- Swap
- Volumes

## Best Practices

When developing plugins, follow these best practices:

1. **Keep Plugins Focused**: Each plugin should focus on a specific aspect of system configuration.

2. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Plugins should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.

3. **Validate Configuration**: Plugins should validate configuration before applying it to the system.

4. **Implement Dry Run**: Plugins should support dry run mode to allow testing configuration changes without applying them.

5. **Document Plugin Behavior**: Document the behavior of your plugin, including its configuration format and supported actions.

6. **Test Thoroughly**: Test your plugin thoroughly to ensure it works correctly in various scenarios.

7. **Consider Dependencies**: Consider dependencies between plugins and handle them appropriately.

# illumos Installer Documentation

Welcome to the illumos Installer Documentation. This guide provides comprehensive information about configuring and using the illumos Installer.

## Overview

The illumos Installer is a system for installing and configuring illumos-based operating systems. It consists of several components that work together to provide a flexible and powerful installation experience.

This documentation focuses on two key components:

1. **Machine Configuration (machineconfig)**: Defines the overall machine configuration, including storage (ZFS pools), system image, and boot environment.

2. **System Configuration (sysconfig)**: Manages system settings such as hostname, network configuration, and other aspects of system configuration through a plugin-based architecture.

## How to Use This Documentation

This documentation is organized into sections that cover different aspects of the illumos Installer:

- **Machine Configuration**: Learn how to define ZFS pools, specify system images, and configure boot environments.
- **System Configuration**: Understand how to configure system settings such as hostname, nameservers, and network interfaces.
- **Appendix**: Find additional resources such as a glossary and troubleshooting guide.

Use the navigation menu on the left to browse through the documentation.

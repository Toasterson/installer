# Advanced Provisioning Features Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the significant enhancements made to the illumos installer's unified provisioning system, extending it with advanced storage management and container orchestration capabilities.

## Overview of Enhancements

The unified provisioning system has been extended with two major feature sets:

1. **Advanced ZFS Storage Management**: Comprehensive ZFS pool topology management, dataset hierarchies, snapshots, and replication
2. **Container Management with Nested Sysconfig**: Support for illumos zones, FreeBSD jails, and Linux containers with full nested configuration capabilities

## Advanced Storage Management Features

### 1. Complex ZFS Pool Topologies

The system now supports sophisticated ZFS pool configurations including:

- **Multi-vdev Data Configuration**: RAIDZ, RAIDZ2, RAIDZ3, mirrors, and stripes
- **Dedicated Log Devices (ZIL)**: Separate high-speed devices for ZFS Intent Log
- **Cache Devices (L2ARC)**: Additional cache layers for improved read performance  
- **Hot Spares**: Automatic failover devices for pool resilience

```json
{
  "topology": {
    "data": [
      {"vdev_type": "raidz2", "devices": ["/dev/disk1", "/dev/disk2", "/dev/disk3", "/dev/disk4"]}
    ],
    "log": [
      {"vdev_type": "mirror", "devices": ["/dev/nvme0", "/dev/nvme1"]}
    ],
    "cache": [
      {"vdev_type": "stripe", "devices": ["/dev/ssd0"]}
    ],
    "spare": ["/dev/spare0"]
  }
}
```

### 2. Hierarchical ZFS Dataset Management

Advanced dataset management with:

- **Nested Dataset Structures**: Parent-child relationships with property inheritance
- **Volume Management**: ZFS volumes (zvols) for VM storage and raw devices

- **Service Isolation**: Independent configuration per container
- **Deployment Automation**: Fully automated multi-tier application deployment

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. Schema Extensions

The `sysconfig-config-schema` has been extended with new data structures:

```rust
// Advanced ZFS storage structures
pub struct ZfsDatasetConfig {
    pub name: String,
    pub dataset_type: ZfsDatasetType,
    pub properties: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub quota: Option<String>,
    pub reservation: Option<String>,
    pub children: Vec<ZfsDatasetConfig>,
}

// Container management structures  
pub struct ContainerConfig {
    pub zones: Vec<ZoneConfig>,
    pub jails: Vec<JailConfig>,
    pub containers: Vec<LinuxContainerConfig>,
}

// Nested configuration support
pub struct ZoneConfig {
    // ... zone configuration ...
    pub sysconfig: Option<Box<UnifiedConfig>>, // Nested configuration
}
```
